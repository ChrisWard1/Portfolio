# Portfolio

I am a recent undergraduate from West Texas A&M. I have included some code that I have written during my tenure with WT. In all of the classes, we worked extensibly in groups remotely. I am very adept at using the remote format. We also pushed all of our assignments to GITHUB or Replit. I have compiled a GITHUB repository called "Portfolio" to highlight some of the work I have done.

The capstone course was called CIDM 4390. At the beginning of the class we did some targeted assignments as a group to see what we knew how to do. We did class and erd diagrams, SQL ddl statements, user and activity diagrams and then started into a C# Agile devolopment project. We managed a Azure Devops repository and then switched to using Github to manage code and Azure to measure the documentation side of the project.
